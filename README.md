## CI/CD Workflows

### Secrets checklist

To ensure that WFs are working properly, add these GH Secrets right after project creation:
- [ ] Secrets for `VAULT_TOKEN` and `VAULT_ENDPOINT` (copy `github-token` and `url` from [https://vault.bndigital.dev](https://vault.bndigital.dev/ui/vault/secrets/infrastructure/show/vault))
- [ ] Secret for `GH_TOKEN` (copy `github-token` from [https://vault.bndigital.dev](https://vault.bndigital.dev/ui/vault/secrets/accounts/show/github/bn-enginseer))
- [ ] Secret for `HARBOR_TOKEN` (copy `api-token` from [https://vault.bndigital.dev](https://vault.bndigital.dev/ui/vault/secrets/accounts/show/dcr.bndigital.dev))

## Staging Rollout

After setting up **_all_**(!) required secrets, perform these actions:
- [ ] In the `Actions` tab, find WF named `Bootstrap` in the left pane
- [ ] Click on the button `Run workflow` in the top-right corner and in pop-up window click green button `Run workflow`
- [ ] After that open code editor of your choice and replace all occurrences of `"project-templates"` in all `package.json` files with the name of your project, run `yarn install` from every location where you have made changes, then commit and push these changes
- [ ] Wait for the `Staging Deployment` workflow to run and check your staging at `REPO_NAME.bndigital.dev`
- [ ] Go to `REPO_NAME.bndigital.dev/admin` and set up Strapi Admin with [these](https://vault.bndigital.dev/ui/vault/secrets/templates/show/project/staging/strapi) credentials
- [ ] Click on the `Settings` option in the menu on the left and on the page that appeared click `Transfer tokens` and then `+ Create new Transfer Token` button inn the top-right corner
- [ ] In the appeared window enter these values:
- For `Name` any name you like (e.g staging_token)
- For `Token duration` select `30 days`
- For `Description` don't put anything
- For `Token type` select `Full access`
- [ ] Then copy appeared token, press `Save` and save it as a GH secret named `STRAPI_STAGING_TRANSFER_TOKEN`
- [ ] Finally, run workflow named `Transfer` the same way you ran `Bootstrap`
- [ ] Say a few kind words to yourself after completing all steps ðŸ™ƒ

## CI/CD Workflows

### Secrets checklist

To ensure that WFs are working properly, add these GH Secrets right after project creation:
- [ ] Secrets for `VAULT_TOKEN` and `VAULT_ENDPOINT` (copy `github-token` and `url` from [https://vault.bndigital.dev](https://vault.bndigital.dev/ui/vault/secrets/infrastructure/show/vault))
- [ ] Secret for `GH_TOKEN` (copy `github-token` from [https://vault.bndigital.dev](https://vault.bndigital.dev/ui/vault/secrets/accounts/show/github/bn-enginseer))

## Staging Rollout

- After setting up secrets, perform these actions:
- [ ] Create new project in [https://dcr.bndigital.dev/] (click `+ New project`, in pop-up window only enter `Project Name`, left other fields unchanged and click `OK` (credentials are here: [https://vault.bndigital.dev](https://vault.bndigital.dev/ui/vault/secrets/accounts/show/dcr.bndigital.dev))
- [ ] In the `Actions` tab, find WF named `Bootstrap` in the left pane
- [ ] Click on the button `Run workflow` in the top-right corner and in pop-up window click green button `Run workflow`
- [ ] After that replace all occurrences of `project-templates` with the name of your project
- [ ] Wait for the `Staging Deployment` workflow to run and check your staging at `REPO_NAME.bndigital.dev`
- [ ] Say a few kind words to yourself after completing all steps ðŸ™ƒ
